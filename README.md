# EDLB-4.0
Minecraft plugin of the classic minigame: Run from the Beast (EDLB from spanish Escapa de la Bestia).

Started developing this over a year ago, but I actually leave minecraft developer community so I stopped working on it.

Based on the minecraft minigame by CookLoco, you'll run from the beast because it will kill you if you don't. Beast is randomly selected from the players that are in the match, the remaining players will be 'runners', those ones who will run from the beast.
